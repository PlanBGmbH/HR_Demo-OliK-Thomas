For each risk identified, propose risk mitigation strategies. The output should be structured in a table format that allows for easy comparison between vendors side by side. Instructions: 1. Identify risks for each vendor, categorized into the following: - **Performance Risks**: Risks related to project delivery, timelines, and ability to meet the stated objectives. - **Technical Risks**: Risks related to technical capabilities, hardware/software compatibility, and overall solution robustness. - **Financial Risks**: Risks related to the financial stability of the vendor, cost overruns, or potential budget impacts. - **Other Risks**: Any other risks such as reputational, legal, or contractual risks. 2. Rate each risk on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 represents the highest risk level. 3. For each risk identified, provide a risk mitigation strategy. 4.

Provide a final summary with a high-level recommendation based on the overall risk assessment. Example: Based on the risk analysis, Vendor 1 presents the highest technical risk but has a strong mitigation plan in place. Vendor 2 offers the most financial stability but faces moderate performance risk due to their limited experience in large-scale projects. Vendor 3 has the lowest technical capability and poses the highest performance risk. Purpose: This risk assessment aims to ensure that the decision is based on a clear understanding of the potential risks associated with each vendor and their ability to mitigate those risks, providing a comprehensive basis for vendor selection."
